# FastAPI Starter Project

## Overview

This is a minimal FastAPI web application serving as a foundation for building REST APIs. The project includes basic routing examples, health check endpoints, and production-ready server configuration using Uvicorn.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Framework
- **FastAPI**: Modern Python web framework chosen for its automatic API documentation, type hints support, and high performance
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application with async support and production capabilities

### Application Structure
- **Single-file architecture**: Currently organized as a simple main.py file suitable for small projects or prototyping
- **Modular design ready**: Empty config.py and __init__.py files indicate preparation for future modularization

### API Design
- **RESTful endpoints**: Standard HTTP methods and URL patterns
- **Type annotations**: Leverages Python type hints for automatic request/response validation
- **Health monitoring**: Dedicated health check endpoint for deployment monitoring

### Configuration Management
- **Environment-based**: Port configuration through environment variables with sensible defaults
- **Production-ready**: Host binding to 0.0.0.0 for container deployment compatibility

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **FastAPI (0.115.0)**: Web framework for building APIs
- **Uvicorn (0.30.6)**: ASGI server with standard extras for production features

### Deployment Considerations
- **Port flexibility**: Configurable via PORT environment variable (defaults to 5000)
- **Container-ready**: Configured for Docker/container deployment with proper host binding
- **No database dependencies**: Currently stateless, ready for database integration when needed
